## x)  Why would you want to use a feed reader
The reason why it’s worth using feed readers is simply their convenience. You can compactly gather content from many different sources into one place in an easy-to-read format. In addition, your privacy is better protected since you don’t need to visit the sites separately in your browser.

## y) Summary of case Osuuspankkikeskus port scan KKO:2003:36
- The Court of Appeal stated that “A,” using a scanning program, scanned all the addresses in the cooperative’s internet-connected network, but the scan did not penetrate the firewall.  

- With a port-scanning program, it is possible to identify potential vulnerabilities in an information system. This procedure can reveal information that may also enable unauthorized access to the targeted system.  

- “A” argued that he could not have committed an attempted data breach, because a scan does not involve forcibly breaking into a system but merely detecting open services. Accessing a system in this way does not require bypassing security measures, as it does not involve using any secret credentials or information.  

- However, the court held that “A” had intentionally attempted to break into another party’s information system. Given his experience and knowledge, A must have understood that merely gaining access to an information system causes harm, even if no data is copied, altered, or destroyed during the intrusion. The same applies to an attempted intrusion into an information system.

## b) / c) / d) / e) Subscribing feeds to feed reader
Here is a screenshot of my current feed.

I added Krebs on Security and Schneier on Security as requested on assignment b) and c).  

I also added two other security related feeds as requested on assignment d). I chose National Cyber Security Centre’s vulnerabilities feed and Paloalto networks blog. 

d) I need the National Cyber Security Centre’s vulnerabilities feed in my current job because it provides up-to-date information about new vulnerabilities. I knew that the National Cyber Security Centre regularly publishes notices through various channels, so I assumed they would also have a developed feed. I found the different feeds offered by the National Cyber Security Centre and their addresses by searching on Google (you can see another available feeds on https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/ncsc-news/rss-feeds).  


Palo Alto Networks’ blog provides interesting content about Network Security, Cloud Security, Security Operations, and Unit 42 Threat Research. They are a major player in the field, and I knew they had an active blog. I eventually found the feed simply by trying to add “feed” to the end of the URL https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/ and it worked perfectly!  

e) I followed a feed for a while and I learned that there was a vulnerability in the giant FortiWeb. The news didn’t come in too quickly, and the headlines alone were enough to tell whether an article was worth reading in full. I will start using feeds in my daily routine, especially for work-related content. Thanks for the tip!  

A downside of relying solely on feeds is that you may end up following only the feed content and not browsing other potential sources. In addition, interesting things might be missed that you could have found by visiting websites in a more traditional way with a browser. It’s therefore a good idea to occasionally look for new possible sources or browse the websites for which you’ve already set up a feed.  

## f) Portscan

Disconnecting computer from internet and testing if it finds ping

Portscanning my own virtual computer using "localhost" as an address.

Connecting back to internet and installing a daemon

Disconnecting again from the internet and testing ping  

<img width="1004" height="114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89e16972-4f3f-4847-be22-70008c19ba2d" />  

Starting a Daemon just in case again and made a port scan

After installing and starting the daemon, a new port called 80/tcp appeared in the port scan, which had not been visible in the earlier scan. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP web traffic, used for loading regular, unencrypted web pages. The port is open when the Apache web server is running.  

Since this was a newly installed virtual machine used for testing, the scanner found relatively little information about the device anyway.  

In the end, I closed the port that I had opened.
