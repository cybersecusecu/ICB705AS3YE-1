# a)
I read Karvinen (2020) https://terokarvinen.com/2020/command-line-basics-revisited/ "Command Line Basics Revisited" guide on basic command line in Linux. I haven't really used Linux much myself before, so the article came in handy. 
I noticed that I already used some of the basic commands presented in the text while doing the assignment. The text itself is a bit odd to summarize into bullet points, since everyone who will read it already has it and it contains a list of useful commands with examples.

- According to Tero the article is popular; it would be interesting to see how much traffic the page gets and whether it comes from around the world, or only among Haaga-Helia students.  

- I kept wondering about the $ history command, whether it shows the commands that happened during the session or all commands given to the terminal over the entire device history. I personally liked using the up-arrow key instead of $ history, which suggested the most recent commands for re-execution. I should test this in the next lab.  

Another article by Karvinen (2022) https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/ "Cracking Passwords with Hashcat" deals with Cracking Passwords with Hashcat. I followed this article closely while doing the exercise myself. As a bullet point I want to raise whether others got the same error during the exercise where VirtualBox gave the message “Device #1: Not enough allocatable device memory for this attack”. This bug apparently stems from the virtual machine's memory, not the device used to open the virtual machine. This prevented me from using hashcat to complete the task.  

In summary the article instructs:
- Hashcat installation
- Downloading a dictionary
- Identifying the hash type
- Cracking the hash
- Finding the password

$ hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved
Gave results

hashcat -m 0 -D 1 -O – n 1 -u 1 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved
Gave error message ”Manual use of the -n option (or –kernel-accel) is outdated.”

Finally added the following commands one at a time while trying to solve the problem, but always the same error message "not enough allocatable device memory".
Tried to use the -w option instead as instructed, but the same error message.

”Device #1: Not enough allocatable device memory for this attack.

$ hashcat -m 0 -D 1 -O -w 1'6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved  

What commands mean:  
hashcat = the program
- -m 0 = directs it to use the correct hash (32 characters).  
- -D 1 = forces Hashcat to use the CPU, not the GPU.  
- -O = reduces memory usage and improves performance  
- -w 1 = uses the lightest workload (reduces memory/CPU load). Recommended in a VM.  
The bug apparently stems from the virtual machine itself, not from the device on which the virtual machine is run. The possibilities to increase allocated memory were apparently quite limited, it might have been possible to direct Hashcat to use the host machine's memory, but that would have been difficult.  

 Idecided to stop fighting at this point and switch to using John the Ripper.

Installing tools required for John the Ripper

The command succeeded without zlib-gst, fortunately it was not needed for the task.
Entered the following commands  
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/openwall/john.git  
$ cd john/src/	  
$ ./configure  

Results required  
$ make -s clean && make -sj2

After that i ran  
$ make -s clean && make -sj4  

Testing that everything works  
$ cd ../run/  
$ ls -1  
$ $HOME/john/run/john

Fetched the password file for the Hashcat task, extracted it, and tested its functionality.

Created "testihash.txt" -file and tested if it works

Ran the command that compares the testhash.txt file against the rockyou.txt wordlist, found one match, and revealed it using the command.  
./john --show --format=raw-md5 myhashes.txt  
Hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96  =  summer
