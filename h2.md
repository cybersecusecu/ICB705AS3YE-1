# a)	Podcast 
Darknet diares Episode 159: Vastaamo https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/159/ 

I chose the topic out of interest, to see whether the podcast would bring something new to the subject that I didn’t know before. It was also interesting to read about the matter from a source other than a Finnish publication. In retrospect, the choice of topic may not have been the most fruitful, as the case might already be familiar to many. I aimed to focus on the material presented in the podcast and summarize the events based on the information it provided.
In the podcast Vastaamo, Jack Rhysider interviews Joe Tidy, who has published the book Ctrl+Alt+Chaos. In this work, Tidy examines global (teenage) hacking groups. The book also discusses Julius Kivimäki, his previous crimes, and especially the Vastaamo case. The podcast touches upon Kivimäki’s former group “Lizard Squad,” which was responsible for bringing down Xbox and PlayStation networks during Christmas 2014.
The main focus, however, is on the data breach targeting the psychotherapy center Vastaamo. The podcast walks listeners through the entire case in general terms, what happened, when, and what the consequences were. It covers the factors that led to Kivimäki’s capture, the repercussions for the company, the extent to which the incident affected victims, and what kind of compensation they received. The episode also revealed, as new information to me, the attitudes of other hackers and forum users toward Kivimäki and the incident. The attack on Vastaamo, the extortion of the company with sensitive data, and especially the blackmailing of victims were widely condemned, not only socially but also by other hackers. This was an interesting aspect I hadn’t encountered before.

The entire case summarized as briefly as possible in a nutshell:
The data breach occurred in 2018, and the information was published on the dark web in 2020. Kivimäki attempted to extort money from the company but failed. He then began releasing data in small batches and accidentally published the entire home directory at once, which played a crucial role in his capture. Kivimäki then directed his extortion directly at the victims (27,000 messages). Estimately, 20 people are known to have paid the ransom. Kivimäki was caught during an inspection visit after loud arguing was heard from his apartment. He was subject to an international arrest warrant, and his fake ID did not pass police scrutiny. In the end, he was sentenced to six years and three months in prison, which he is currently serving.

# b)	Blog 
Scheier on Security: Negotiating with Ransomware Gangs

I try to find a blog in the aspect of cybercrime victims and found a blog discussing various aspects of ransom payments. Extortion places victims in a difficult situation where the decision to pay or not to pay is more a practical than a legal question. Paying a ransom usually does not break the law, but it is ethically and commercially problematic.
The blog lists reasons for paying ransoms:
•	Often the cheapest and fastest solution.  
•	May help avoid fines or reputational damage from data leaks.  
•	Prevents the exposure of sensitive information.  
•	If no one paid, such scams would no longer be profitable.  
•	In some cases, it might be in the best interest of stakeholders, as could be argued in the Vastaamo case.

On the other hand, there are arguments against paying:  
•	Does not guarantee data recovery.  
•	Funds criminal activity and encourages future attacks.  
•	May harm the brand and attract further attacks.  
•	No guarantee that the attacks will stop or that the data won’t still be leaked.

# c) Scientific aspect
I searched for articles related to cyberattacks, focusing on the victims’ perspective. According to Reep van den Bergh and Junger’s article (2018), Victims of cybercrime in Europe: a review of victim surveys, “A higher internet usage gives a higher risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime.” The Vastaamo case was interesting in this regard, as the victims were targets of a cyberattack even though they had not used computers themselves. The victims’ actions had no influence on the incident, nor could they have prevented it in any way. The article highlights that frauds of this kind are very rare, but when they do occur, they often have a large emotional and financial impact on their victims. It should be noted that the article is somewhat outdated, which affects its reliability, especially since cybercrime is constantly increasing. However, the points I refer to are not based on statistics, so the publication date is not of major importance.
The article Exploring the psychological profile of cybercriminals: A comprehensive review for improved cybercrime prevention (Trinh, Dinh & Tran, 2025) discussed the effects of cyberattacks on victims. Common reactions include chronic stress, anxiety, and depression, as such crimes invade private spaces and create a constant sense of insecurity. Many victims suffer from sleep problems, withdraw from social life, and lose trust in digital safety. What makes this case particularly distressing is that it involved extremely confidential information discussed in therapy sessions, and that the threats were directed personally at the victims.
Cyberattacks can disrupt business operations, cause financial losses, and damage reputations. They can lead to service outages, data loss, and interruptions, all of which undermine customer trust. Restoring reputation and rebuilding trust require significant resources. (Trinh, Dinh & Tran, 2025)
Vastaamo eventually went bankrupt in 2021. However, according to the podcast, the company’s CEO, Ville Tapio, stated that the company could have survived the crisis if he had been allowed to stay in control. When the company received the first ransom note, they contacted the police, after which the police took over the situation. Police took over also the CEO’s email account and continued communicating with Kivimäki through his email. In the Vastaamo case, the company did not pay the ransom. Therefore, the decision not to pay the ransom may have been made by the police rather than the CEO. 
When the victims received the extortion letters, they were also advised not to pay. According to the podcast, the reasoning was that paying would be pointless since the data had already been leaked once by Kivimäki (accidentally).
