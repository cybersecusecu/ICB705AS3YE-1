## a) 
I used Google Scholar to find the article. Initially, I tried to locate a relevant article on social engineering, but many of the articles I found from two years ago were not listed in the JUFO portal. Therefore, I changed my approach and searched using the query “intitle:review: incident response.” I found a one-year-old article titled “Evolution of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) in Cyber Security: A Comprehensive Review”, which discusses the development of Endpoint Detection and Response solutions. The article is JUFO-rated (JUFO ID 86108 Level 1). However, I must note that the publisher, E3S Web of Conferences, is not primarily focused on technical fields, even though the article was published there. Thus, the JUFO rating may have been earned through publications in other fields, which slightly reduces its reliability.

## b)
- What are the key areas being researched?
   - EDR as a whole.
   - More specifically, the role and coverage of EDR, the evolution of EDR technology over time, EDR challenges, and the future direction of EDR.
   - Explanation of Extended Detection and Response (XDR).

- What's widely agreed upon?
  - EDR is an essential part of cybersecurity, as attacks often target endpoints.
  - Machine learning and AI can understand complex patterns and process data far better than humans. They also reduce the need for manual work and speed up response times.
  - XDR is considered the natural next step in the evolution of EDR.

- What are the open questions?
  - Machine learning algorithms often struggle to contextualize events within broader security landscapes, potentially leading to false positives or missed detections.
  - AI-driven EDR systems often rely on vast amounts of data, including private user and device information, which raises serious privacy concerns.
  - How can we effectively protect against adversarial manipulation? Techniques like data poisoning and evasion attacks have the potential to compromise the integrity and effectiveness of machine learning–based security systems.
