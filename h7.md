I structured the course into five separate sessions. I will present the plan session by session and include the theme, exercises, and objectives.  

## Session 1 theme: “The organization’s cybersecurity ecosystem”

**Objective 1:**  
Understand the importance of cybersecurity in an organization and the methods an organization can use to protect itself against attacks and monitor its operations.

**1st session exercises:**  

- Prioritizing security controls: determining which controls should be prioritized and why.  

- Building a risk map for one’s own organization.  

- Case: “What if this happened to us?” A short data breach scenario where the group analyzes which controls would have prevented or detected the incident.  

- Guest lecturer (Security Manager): “How do we manage cybersecurity in a real organization?”  

## Session 2 theme: “Builder of security culture - communication, motivation, and change”  

**Objective 2:**  
Be an active contributor who can explain to staff why cybersecurity matters, justify investments, clarify the impact of policies, and foster a positive attitude toward security.  

**2nd session exercises**  

- 1-minute elevator pitch: “Why is cybersecurity important for our organization?”  

- Role-play: The student explains to a busy team why a new practice (e.g., mandatory device management for logins) is necessary.  

Guest lecturer 1: How to talk about cybersecurity in an engaging, non-fear-based way?  

Guest lecturer 2: Change management (security point of view, real life examples)  


## Session 3 theme: “User responsibility in preventing security incidents”

**Objective 3:**  
Recognize the importance of cybersecurity in one’s own actions.  

**3rd session exercises**  

- Identifying phishing messages.  

- Social media discovery / Mapping one’s own digital footprint.  

- Group scenario walkthroughs: How to act in different situations (e.g., finding an unknown USB stick).  

- Introduction to the “minimum security baseline” model.  

Guest lecturer 1: Data Protection Officer (DPO): The user’s responsibility in handling personal data and work systems.  

Guest lecturer 2: Security trainer / SOC analyst: Presentation of real (anonymized) cases of “human errors.”  


## Session 4 theme: “Attacker mindsets and anticipation”

**Objective 4:**  
Understand how attackers think and be able to anticipate actions before damage occurs.  

**4th session exercises**  

- Kill Chain breakdown: The group receives a fictional attack scenario and identifies each phase of the attack. In a second step, they develop a proactive plan to prevent the attack.  

- Attacker profile creation: Motives, goals, resources.  


Guest lecturer 1: Ethical hacker: Explains an attacker’s perspective and also presents an anonymized real case step by step.  

Guest lecturer 2: Social engineer: Demonstrates how attacks can happen both via phone and through physical intrusion.  


## Session 5 theme: “Light investigation and incident response for cyber incidents”  

**Objective 5:**  
Be able to perform a light cybersecurity investigation and take preventive actions in case of an attack.   


**5th session exercises**  

- Group scenario exercises in the lab: Students work on light scenarios such as a suspicious file, unusual logs, or a strange phone call.  

- Assessment of response procedures: Students are given a fictional incident process and suggest improvements.  

- Investigation of a real case study (anonymized).  

SOC environment visit: Demonstration of how incidents are investigated in practice.
