Key steps in the Cybermeter assessment process include initiating, preparing for, and conducting the assessment. In addition, the process involves identifying development activities, after which the activities are carried out and the assessment is updated.  

In summary, the management team appoints an assessment sponsor and a facilitator, who together define the operations to be assessed and agree on the assessment method. The assessment facilitator conducts the assessment, analyses the results, identifies the necessary development activities, and finally implements and updates those activities.  

Cybermeter maturity model is designed for the assessment and development of cybersecurity capabilities.
The model serves to assess cybersecurity capabilities at four maturity indicator levels (0-3):
Level 0 Activities do not meet basic requirements. 
Level 1 Activities meet basic requirements, but mainly ad hoc
Level 2 Activities are more advanced and comprehensive than at lower levels. 
Level 3 Activities are advanced and comprehensive.  


Cybermeter consists of 11 cybersecurity domains, each with defined objectives and practices used to measure how well those objectives are fulfilled. It is recommended that the assessment covers all domains so that the final outcome provides an overall view of the organisation’s cybersecurity activities and helps identify any hidden vulnerabilities. As a result, a cybersecurity maturity indicator level is calculated for all 11 domains.  

Cybermeter includes 52 objectives, divided so that each domain contains three to five cybersecurity objectives. These objectives represent the targets that every organisation should achieve in its operations to protect against cyber threats.  

The Cybermeter maturity report is a detailed document intended for analysing and reporting the assessment results, as well as for guiding internal development.

Regarding the Cybermeter tool itself, it includes 11 domains, each containing three to five cybersecurity objectives. Under each objective, there are detailed criteria that can be evaluated using a maturity scale to determine how well they are fulfilled. In addition, the tool allows adding comments, references, and identified development needs. The tool also provides access to previous assessments, which helps in conducting a new assessment and makes it easy to compare changes.  

## a) Make-belief analysis
The following discussion relates to the Cybermeter Access domain and the cybersecurity objective 2. Control Logical Access.

Rick has just started in the company in a new role as CISO (Chief Information Security Officer). The company is renewing its information security practices and is using the Cybermeter assessment tool as part of this process. He and the management team made the changes visible in the screenshot and reviewed them with the staff.

John (a DevOps developer) and Rick (the CISO) are discussing the disappearance of the admin credentials from John’s workstation. John is wondering why the admin rights he had been using to install various programs on his machine have been removed. He has been granted a powerful workstation, which he has also used during his free time for small projects and personal activities. John questions why his admin rights and the ability to install software were taken away, especially since he has been with the company for a long time and is technically skilled. Previously, he was allowed to use the machine as he wished, and no restrictions were placed on the device.  

Rick justified the decision by referring to the company’s increased focus on security and explained the comments in the assessment table in more detail. The removal of admin rights was based solely on the fact that John does not need administrator privileges for his daily work. If a situation arises where he does need them, he can still obtain temporary admin rights for a day with a valid justification. The workstation is also intended strictly for work-related tasks, not for hobbies or personal activities. Without admin rights, an attacker’s ability to act in the event of a breach is significantly more limited compared to a scenario where administrator privileges are available.

## b) Sucks or succeeds
The Cybermeter can be ineffective if it is carried out by the wrong people or if the form is simply filled in without reacting to the identified deficiencies. It also loses value if the results are intentionally polished instead of answering honestly about the current situation. Furthermore, if the assessment is performed only once and not maintained, effective use and follow-up remain minimal, undermining the whole purpose. In addition, if no financial investment is made in security or if it lacks management support, concrete improvements will remain limited.  

The Cybermeter works best when it is completed honestly, regularly, and by the right people. When resources are allocated to the process and cybersecurity, and when the initiative comes from top management, the results are much more meaningful. The findings should be incorporated into an action plan, and in an optimal scenario, the organisation may pursue certifications such as ISO 27001 as proof that security is being taken seriously.  


## c) Competition
The previously mentioned ISO 27001 functions as a competing and official tool for measuring security activities. “ISO/IEC 27001 is the world's best-known standard for information security management systems (ISMS).” (ISO 2025) Obtaining the certification is proof that a company invests in security and has achieved a recognised standard through its actions. It demonstrates that concrete measures have been taken rather than merely claiming to operate securely. The downside, however, is the required resources, as the certification process can be costly. In addition, the process is relatively heavy and bureaucratic.  

NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce. (Federal Trade Commission 2025) The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is voluntary, and it helps organisations understand cybersecurity risks and protect their networks and data. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is quite similar to the Cybermeter, but its drawback is that it was developed in the United States and is aligned with U.S. laws and protocols. For this reason, it is advisable to use the Cybermeter as the primary reference and compare it with the NIST Framework where useful, in case there are relevant elements that the Cybermeter does not include.
