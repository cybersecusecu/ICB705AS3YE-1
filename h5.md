### Karvinen, T. (2023). PGP – Send encrypted and signed message – gpg.  
Article shows how you can use PGP encryption with gpg-tool. It includes creating a keypair, exporting and importing public key, verifying fingerprint and thrusting the key.

## a) Pubkey today
”The most recent applications of standard RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) are incorporated in key exchanges, digital signatures, web browsers, chat applications, emails, VPNs and any other types of communication where data transmission between two parties is required” (Imam et al., 2021). Just yesterday alone, I sent emails and connected to the VPN from the aforementioned list. In VPN connections, the process typically starts with key generation, during which a pair of public and private keys is created. Encryption then transforms readable plain text into cipher text, while decryption reverses this process to restore the original data. TLS and SSL are security protocols designed to create an encrypted channel between a browser and a web server, ensuring that any information exchanged remains confidential and protected. TLS maintains privacy by preventing unauthorized parties from accessing the actual contents of the transmitted messages. It also ensures data integrity by detecting any alterations to the information in transit. Additionally, TLS provides authentication for at least one endpoint. Meanwhile, an SSL VPN delivers end-to-end encryption between the VPN client and server. (Yeboah-Ofori & Ganiyu, 2024)  

## b) Encrypt a message.
I chose CyberChef as my encryption tool and used its AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) module. I wanted to experiment with how well lightweight message encryption works, and CyberChef is a familiar tool to me. For the mode, I selected AES Cipher Block Chaining (CBC). CBC encrypts blocks of data by chaining them together. Each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. The chaining ensures that even small changes in the plaintext affect multiple ciphertext blocks. (Elheni 2025)  

For both the password and the IV, I chose UTF-8 for convenience, even though using HEX would have been more secure. I input the text in RAW format and requested the output in HEX.

I restarted the site in incognito mode. This time, I selected the AES decryption module and entered the keys required for decryption. The message decrypted successfully.  
<img width="1559" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5086603e-3731-4370-b035-dd98f3960de7" />  

I became curious about the role of the IV, so I replaced it with a random string of characters. To my surprise, only the beginning of the message became garbled while the rest remained readable. I spent far too long discussing this issue with ChatGPT and ended up going down a rabbit hole without finding a solution. Unfortunately, I was unable to determine why CBC was not behaving as expected—specifically: “chaining ensures even small changes in plaintext affect multiple ciphertext blocks.”
Most likely, this feature is not implemented correctly in CyberChef. I tried encrypting messages of different lengths with different keys, but could not solve the problem.  

<img width="1004" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d88959f-cdde-4786-860b-ffa0486caaad" />  

**Evaluation**

The encryption did not work correctly and resulted in only about 80% of the message being properly “encrypted.” For this reason, I would not recommend using CyberChef for message encryption. Its reliability is further reduced by the fact that AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm. “Symmetric” means the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Unlike asymmetric encryption, where different keys are required for decryption, symmetric encryption is not as robust for message sharing.

Frustrated with the failed CBC experiment, I decided to try GCM mode, which includes a TAG for additional authentication. This encryption mode worked excellently, and even a one-character change in the IV caused the program to completely fail to decrypt the message. The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) also worked as expected: it did not change the HEX output but did alter the TAG, which is used during decryption. In practice, decrypting the message requires three pieces of information—Key, Tag, and Additional Authenticated Data—which increases security even further.
<img width="1004" height="562" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0159fd2d-e111-46f9-8594-ea88c1e16471" />  
<img width="1004" height="539" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3915a8fe-54c6-4fcd-8bad-a637c70a55bf" />  

Even so, I still would not fully trust browser-based encryption tools. However, if I absolutely had to send a message over an unsecured channel, I might consider AES-GCM.

## c) Eve and Mallory

Eve’s passive listening / monitoring is prevented by encrypting messages with a public key so that they can only be opened with the corresponding private key. The flags are used as follows:  
--encrypt = encrypt the message  
--recipient = selects the recipient’s key  
--armor = makes the message ASCII formatted (easier to transmit)  

PGP protects the message against Mallory with a digital signature. Alice adds a signature to the message with her own private key. Tero checks the signature with Alice’s public key. If the message had been modified in transit, the signature would no longer match.  

In addition, Alice and Tero verify the fingerprints of their public keys by phone to make sure the keys belong to the correct people. Once the keys have been verified, they are marked as trusted.  
--sign = adding a digital signature  
--decrypt = Recipient verifies the signature using the sender’s public key signature  
--fingerprint = identifies the correct key   
--sign-key = marks the key as trusted  

## d) Password management
I chose KeePassXC for this task because I wanted to test how an offline password manager works. I downloaded and installed the program on my computer. Unfortunately, I couldn’t take any screenshots of the application, as it would hide itself every time I attempted to capture the screen. This is actually a very good security feature, but it does make documenting its functionality more difficult.
<img width="1004" height="699" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733bae36-bfe1-4935-8271-dbca09819e86" />  
You cand download KeePassXC from https://keepassxc.org/download/#windows.

After installing the program, I created a new database and added a test password. To create an entry, the program required a title, username, URL, and the password itself. KeePassXC also includes a built-in password generator, which is a useful feature for creating strong passwords.

Another advantage of the program is that you can set a delay for how long it takes to load the database after entering the master password. This is an excellent feature for defending against brute-force attacks. A five-second delay is barely noticeable for the user, but for a brute-force attack, it multiplies the cracking time by five for every attempt. This feature should be implemented in more applications.  

People who don’t use a password manager are more vulnerable to security threats. If the same password is used across different services, a password leaked from one site can be used to access accounts on others. When you have to remember passwords yourself, it’s easy to choose predictable ones, whereas a password manager makes that unnecessary. Using a password manager also helps protect against malware keyloggers or shoulder-surfers, since the password doesn’t need to be typed manually.
